Hello world
===================================

**agile_autonomy** (/lu'make/) is a drone repo for "Learning High-Speed Flight in the Wild<https://github.com/uzh-rpg/agile_autonomy>"__.
Quadrotors are agile. Unlike most other machines, they can traverse extremely complex environments at high speeds. To date, only expert human pilots have been able to fully exploit their capabilities. Autonomous operation with on-board sensing and computation has been limited to low speeds. State-of-the-art methods generally separate the navigation problem into subtasks: sensing, mapping, and planning. While this approach has proven successful at low speeds, the separation it builds upon can be problematic for high-speed navigation in cluttered environments.
